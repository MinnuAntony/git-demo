## ⚙️ Merge vs Rebase — The Core Difference

| Concept                       | **Merge**                                     | **Rebase**                                                                    |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**                   | Combine the work from two branches            | Move your branch to start from a new base (like updating it with latest main) |
| **What it does**              | Creates a **new commit** that joins histories | **Rewrites** your branch commits on top of another branch                     |
| **Affects history?**          | No (keeps old commits)                        | Yes (changes commit IDs — new, linear history)                                |
| **When to use**               | When you’re *integrating* changes into main   | When you’re *updating* your feature branch with new main commits              |
| **Resulting history**         | May include merge commits                     | Looks clean and straight                                                      |
| **Safe for shared branches?** | ✅ Yes                                         | ⚠️ No (avoid rebasing shared branches)                                        |

## 💡 Think of it like this:

* 🔹 **Merge** = “Hey, let’s bring your work *into* mine.”
* 🔹 **Rebase** = “Let me move my work so it *starts* from the latest version of yours.”

## 🧩 Typical Real-World Usage Flow

Here’s how developers usually use both together 👇

### ✅ Step 1: Create a feature branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature2
```

### ✅ Step 2: Do your work, commit changes

Meanwhile, other developers push new commits to `main`.

Now your local history looks like:

```
main:      A --- B --- C
feature2:        \
                  D --- E
```

---

### ✅ Step 3: Rebase to update your feature branch

Before merging, bring your branch up-to-date with main:

```bash
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
```

Now your branch looks like:

```
main:      A --- B --- C
feature2:                  D' --- E'
```

✅ Still no effect on main.
✅ You’re now working on top of the latest main commits.

---

### ✅ Step 4: Merge into main when ready

After testing your branch, you merge it into main (via PR or command line):

```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature2
git push
```

Now the main branch includes all your rebased commits cleanly:

```
main:  A --- B --- C --- D' --- E'
```

✅ Main updated
✅ Clean history
✅ No unnecessary merge commit

### ⚠️ Summary Rule of Thumb

| Goal                                           | Use                    |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| You want to **combine** work                   | `git merge`            |
| You want to **catch up** with latest main      | `git rebase`           |
| You want **clean, linear** history             | `git rebase`           |
| You’re working with a **team / shared branch** | `git merge` (safer)    |
| You’re working **alone on a feature branch**   | `git rebase` (cleaner) |

---

### 🚀 In short:

> 🔹 **Rebase** = Keep your branch up to date.
> 🔹 **Merge** = Bring your branch’s work into main.

---

🧩 Practical Rule

🔹 git merge main → “Bring main’s changes into my feature branch.”

🔹 git rebase main → “Pretend my work started from the latest main.”

Both update your branch.
The difference is just how the history looks — one adds a merge commit, the other rewrites your commits.
